# FizzBuzz Challenge

This repository contains a JavaScript function to solve the FizzBuzz problem.

## Problem Statement

Write a JavaScript function that prints numbers from 1 to 100.  
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz".  
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz".  
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".  

## Example Output
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11

## The Solution Approach

The solution uses:
- A 'for' loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 100.
- Conditional checks to determine whether a number is divisible by 3, 5, or both.
- Prints the appropriate output for each case.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KyathiY/fizzbuzz_Task
